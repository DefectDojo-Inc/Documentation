## Consultant Mode

Consultant mode provides the ability for companies to include outsiders (e.g. consultants, developers, customers, and/or other non-security professionals) in their Defect Dojo instance without sharing too much information.

When consultant mode is enabled, global reporting and metrics will be entirely disabled and inaccessible by any user that does not have at least staff permissions. Only product type reporting and metrics (at the highest level) can be measured by these users.

Consultant mode is disabled by default.

## Toggling Consultant Mode

Consultant mode can be enabled and disabled within the account settings dropdown by selecting _Consultant Mode_.

When a cross mark is displayed next to the _Consultant Mode_ text, consultant mode is disabled.
