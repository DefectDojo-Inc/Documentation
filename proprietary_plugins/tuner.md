## Custom Settings

Custom Settings adds additional settings to your DefectDojo instance, including fine tuning deduplication, SAML settings, SSO configuration and SMTP server configuration.

_Note:_ SMTP server configuration is only available for on-premise customers.

To access these additional settings, navigate to the appropriate _Settings_ page under the _Plugin Manager_ tab within the sidebar. Please note, the name of this tab will depend on your DefectDojo level (e.g. _Plus_, _Pro_, or _Enterprise_).

## Deduplication Settings

Deduplication settings provide the option to select a specific deduplication algorithm, as well as the fields which will be considered when deduplication is performed.

Before configuring custom deduplication settings for a specific tool, said tool must have previously been used and recognized by DefectDojo. In addition, a deduplication algorithm (a detailed list can be found [here](https://documentation.defectdojo.com/usage/features/#deduplication-algorithms)) and desired fields for indentifying duplicates must be selected. 

Once proper choices have been made, deduplication settings may be saved via the _Submit_ button.

_Note:_ Once these settings are saved, the hashcode for each finding will be re-calculated asynchronously, and a server reset will be forced.

## SAML Settings

The SAML settings provide custom SAML configuration for a given DefectDojo instance. The following is a description of each available SAML configuration field:

__Entity ID__ (_required_) - a string that identifies DefectDojo to the SAML IdP
__Login Button Text__ - the text displayed on the SAML login button when displayed on the DefectDojo login page
__Logout URL__ - the logout URL that closes a given SAML session
__Required Attributes__ - only accounts with these defined attributes will be authorized successfully
__Attribute Mapping__ (_required_) - the mapping from SAML attributes to DefectDojo fields
__Remote SAML Metadata__ - the SAML metadata that is retrievable via HTTP by the IdP
__Local SAML Metadata__ - the SAML metadata that generated by the IdP in XML format and stored locally (_Note:_ After this file is submitted, there will be no indicator of it being uploaded.)
__Create Unknown User__ - when enabled, users that successfully authorize via SAML that do not already exist within DefectDojo will have a new user account provisioned
__Allow Unknown Attributes__ - when enabled, users that have attributes not configured in the attribute mappings can still successfully authorize to DefectDojo
__Sign Assertions__ - when disabled, DefectDojo will not consume any SAML assertions that are not signed
__Sign Responses__ - when disabled, DefectDojo will not consume any SAML responses that are not signed
__Sign Logout Requests__ - when enabled, logoout requests will need to be signed by DefectDojo
__Force Authentication__ - when enabled, DefectDojo will force user login without relying on sessions
__Enable SAML debugging__ - when enabled, more verbose output will be present in the logs for debuggin issues
__Enable SAML__ - when enabled, the button to login via SAML will be present on the login page (_Note:_ If the _Enable SAML_ field is not checked, no SAML login button will be displayed on the DefectDojo login page.)

Once the above fields have been appropriately populated, the SAML settings can be saved via the _Submit_ button.

_Note:_ Once these settings are saved, a server reset will be forced.

## SSO Settings

DefectDojo provides numerous offerings for SSO through proprietary custom settings, including _Auth0_, _Azure AD_, _GitHub_, _GitHub Enterprise_, _GitLab_, _Google_, _KeyCloak_, and _Okta_. To configure a specific SSO offering, select it from the dropdown for configuration.

![SSO Options](../../images/tuner/ts-sso-options.png)

For example, if _Auth0_ configuration was desired, once selected from the dropdown, the following fields would need to be populated:

__Auth0 OAuth Key__ - the key associated with your Auth0 OAuth instance
__Auth0 OAuth Secret__ - the secret associated with your Auth0 OAuth instance
__Auth0 Domain__ - the domain of your Auth0 OAuth instance
__Enable Auth0 OAuth__ - when enabled, the button to login via Auth0 will be present on the login page
 
While this example only covers _Auth0_ configuration settings, each of the offerings for SSO requires similar data entries. Once the above fields have been appropriately filled in, the SSO settings for a given offering can be saved via the _Submit_ button.

![Specific SSO Options](../../images/tuner/ts-sso-auth0.png)

In addition to settings for each specific SSO offering, a small subset of settings general to all SSO methods can be viewed under the _SSO Settings_ page. The following options are included:

__Show Username and Password__ -  when enabled, the username and password fields remain present on the login page and can be used for login
__Allow Login with Username and Password__ - when enabled, the login button by username and password is present
__Allow Forgot Password__ - when enabled, users can start the process of resetting their passwords from the login page
__Create User on Successful Login__ - when enabled, users authorized by SSO that do not already exist in DefectDojo can be created with minimal permissions
__Auto Redirect to SSO Page__ - when enabled, visiting DefectDojo will automatically redirect to the SSO login page (_Note:_ This only works with one SSO connection configured)

These settings may be saved via the _Submit_ button.

## SMTP Server Settings

SMTP Server Settings provides the ability to configure an SMTP server for a given DefectDojo instance. To properly configure SMTP server settings, the following fields must be populated (_Note:_ This functionality is only offered to customers who have purchased an on-premise DefectDojo license):

__Host__ - the host of the SMTP server
__User__ - the user to connect to the SMTP server as
__Password__ - the password of the user connecting to the SMTP server
__Port__ - the port the SMTP server is listening on

Once filled in, these settings may be saved via the _Submit_ button.
