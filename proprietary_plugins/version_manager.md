## Version Manager

The version manager within Defect Dojo provides support for managing the base Defect Dojo version by periodically checking for new versions of Defect Dojo in one of the following locations: _Defect Dojo Open Source_ or _Proprietary Offerings via Defect Dojo's GCP Artifact Registry_.

To view the current Defect Dojo version information of a given instance, navigate to the _Version Manager Settings_ page within the sidebar.

## Version Manager Settings

Within the _Version Manager Settings_ page, you will find all the necessary information regarding the Defect Dojo version, as well as options to elect for automatic updates, and set a reminder date to check for updates.

## Version Manager Notifications

When the reminder date set in the _Version Manager Settings_ page is reached, a popup will be displayed that allows the user to either postpone the upgrade reminder, or perform the upgrade.

If the user wishes to begin the upgrade when the reminder is shown, the _Update Now_ button can be selected, which will then begin the upgrade process.
